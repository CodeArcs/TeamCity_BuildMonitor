Installation
-------------

Download the repository and compile it on order to download all required NuGet packages. If you don't have automatic NuGet package restore enabled in Visual Studio, then it will have to be enabled.

Open `Web.AppSettings.config` and enter your TeamCity server information into the settings labeled `teamcity_username`, `teamcity_password` and `teamcity_api_url`.

In the constructor of `HomeController.cs`, you can switch between using `DefaultBuildMonitorModelHandler` (shows all jobs in TeamCity automatically) or the `CustomBuildMonitorModelHandler` which allows you to customize what to display. You can customize your personal view by editing the file `App_Data/Settings.xml`.
